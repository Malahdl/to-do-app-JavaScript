Welcome to the To-Do app!.

This is a simple JavaScript app where you can create new tasks and set a time limit for them. You will see three tabs: "In Progress", "Done" and "Unfinished". The new tasks will be displayed in the "In Progress" tab, if you finish a task before its due date, it will be moved to the "Done" tab, otherwise it will be moved to the "Unfinished" tab.

Your tasks will be saved on your local storage, and you can remove them as well.

You can watch the demonstration video for more clarity.

You can also see some snapshots of the app in the "samples" folder.
