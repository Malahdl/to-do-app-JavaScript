# Welcome to the To-Do app!

# Description:
This is a simple JavaScript app where you can create tasks and check them as done when you finish them.

# Features:
1. You can create new tasks without any limit.
2. You can set a due date for any task.
3. You can remove any task.
4. Your tasks will be divided into three categories: "In Progress", "Done" & "Unfinished".
5. Your new tasks will be placed in the "In Progress" category.
6. If you finish a task before its due date, it will be moved to the "Done" category.
7. If you didn't finish a task before its due date, it will be moved to the "Unfinished" category.
8. Your tasks will be saved in your local storage so that they don't disappear with every loading.

# Important Notes:
* You can watch the demonstration video from the "demonstration" folder for more clarity.
* You can see some snapshots of the app in the "samples" folder.
